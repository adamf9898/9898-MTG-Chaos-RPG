Rules
  Each player chooses 3 booster pack styles between either historic draft booster or standard draft booster.

  A standard booster pack will generate whatever the sets are in the current rotation of the standard format and from those generates 1 basic land, 10 commons, 3 uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare.

  A standard draft booster pack will generate whatever the sets are in the current rotation of the standard format and from those generates 10 commons, 4 uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare.

  A historic booster pack will generate from any sets and from those generates 1 basic land, 10 commons, 3 uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare.

  A historic draft booster pack will generate from an y sets and from those generates 10 commons, 4 uncommons, and 1 rare or mythic rare.

  Click the appropiate decision on the booster pack generator to generate 1 booster pack each time clicked. Drag a box around the cards generated to highlight them then press G on the keyboard to group them.

  Repeat this process until all players have 3 packs generated.

  Players will then save the cards as an object to be their Inventory! DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!

  Players then begin to create a minimum deck including basic lands of 40 cards. Again DO NOT FORGET TO SAVE YOUR INVENTORY!

  You will not be able to edit your deck after this step until you are told that you may do so.

  Once all players have saved their inventory with a starting deck and any extra cards, the Game Board phase now begins.

  From the Unmarked Boards, shuffle and drag one out for it to begin as the starting game board.

  Each board has its own rules and a rule notecard!

  After moving on a game board, you do the tile corresponding deck effect first!
  After that effect has resolved, then you must use the random encounter generator!

  Players start with 1000 Gold and 10 Mana Link known as life.

  Further instructions will be written soon!

  This game must be used with the generator at the website:

  Base Race — A grid-based strategy game where you take turns moving cards to uncover the location of your opponent's face-down land. <p> <div class="card-text ">         <h1 class="card-text-title" lang="en">           <span class="card-text-card-name">               Base Race           </span> </h1>        <p class="card-text-type-line" lang="en">           Card </p>          <div class="card-text-box" lang="en">               <div class="card-text-oracle">                 <p>2 players | 3 packs | 10 minutes</p>  <p>OBJECTIVE:</p>  <p>Competition among treasure hunters on Zendikar is fierce. Find your opponent’s base camp before they find yours!</p>  <p>GET READY:</p>  <p>Open three packs, give one basic land to each player, then remove any remaining land cards and any cards without Magic card backs. Shuffle the remaining cards together and deal 11 cards to each player.</p>  <p>Each player then looks at their cards and arranges them face down in a 4x3 grid opposite their opponent. The completed play area should be 4x6 with no extra spaces. The first player to finish their grid goes first.</p>  <p>LET’S PLAY:</p>  <p>On their turn, each player moves one of their cards one space either vertically or horizontally—not diagonally, and not onto a space occupied by another card they own.</p>  <p>You can use your turn to move a card safely onto an</p>               </div> </div>        <h1 class="card-text-title" lang="en">           <span class="card-text-card-name">               Base Race (cont'd)           </span> </h1>        <p class="card-text-type-line" lang="en">           Card </p>          <div class="card-text-box" lang="en">               <div class="card-text-oracle">                 <p>empty space. Moving a card onto a space occupied by an opponent’s card starts a battle! Reveal both cards and do the following for each card type:</p>  <p>If both revealed cards are Creatures/Artifact Creatures, the card with the higher toughness wins and remains face up; the loser is discarded. If they tie, the attacker wins.</p>  <p>Legendary Creatures/Planeswalkers always win against nonlegendary creatures. When they battle each other, the higher toughness or loyalty wins. If they tie, the attacker wins.</p>  <p>If either of the revealed cards is an Instant/Sorcery/Enchantment, discard both revealed cards. <i>(Other effects still happen.)</i></p>  <p>If one of the revealed cards is an Artifact, the player who owns it discards it and takes an extra turn. If both revealed cards are Artifacts, only the attacker gets the extra turn.</p>  <p>TO WIN:</p>  <p>When a Land is revealed in battle, its owner loses the game.

Players make their piles with the goal of winning a series of Magic games with these modified rules:</p>  <p>Players start at 5 life, have infinite mana, and cannot lose by drawing from an empty library.</p>  <p>LET’S PLAY:</p>  <p>Randomly determine who goes first. Each player chooses which pile their opponent will use for each round. Then both players draw all three of their cards and play a game of Magic. When a player loses a game, they get to go first in the next game.</p>  <p>TO WIN:</p>  <p>The first player to win two games wins the match.</p>               </div> </div>        <p class="card-legality-warning">           <b class="card-legality-warning-pill">Not Legal</b>           <span>             This card is memorabilia and not legal for play.           </span>         </p>     </div>
  Booster Sleuth — A deduction game where you try to figure out four key facts about a secret card using just the other cards in the pack as clues. <p> <div class="card-text ">         <h1 class="card-text-title" lang="en">           <span class="card-text-card-name">               Booster Sleuth           </span> </h1>        <p class="card-text-type-line" lang="en">           Card </p>          <div class="card-text-box" lang="en">               <div class="card-text-oracle">                 <p>2 players | 2 packs | 10 minutes</p>  <p>OBJECTIVE:</p>  <p>Unlike Jace, not all of us can rely on telepathy to solve a mystery. Using other cards as clues, discover all the facts about your opponent’s mystery card.</p>  <p>GET READY:</p>  <p>Randomly determine who goes first—that player is the Secretkeeper, and their opponent is the Detective. First, the Secretkeeper opens a pack and removes any lands and cards without Magic card backs. Next, they shuffle the remaining cards and pick one at random. That card is the mystery card. Finally, the Secretkeeper gives the Detective the rest of the cards, and the game begins.</p>  <p>LET’S PLAY:</p>  <p>The Detective must correctly guess four facts</p>               </div> </div>        <h1 class="card-text-title" lang="en">           <span class="card-text-card-name">               Booster Sleuth (cont'd)           </span> </h1>        <p class="card-text-type-line" lang="en">           Card </p>          <div class="card-text-box" lang="en">               <div class="card-text-oracle">                 <p>about the mystery card: converted mana cost, color, card type, and the number of words in its name. To do this, they choose and reveal cards one at a time.</p>  <p>When each card is revealed, the Secretkeeper tells the Detective how many of the four facts that card and the mystery card have in common. Then the Detective may either guess the four facts or reveal another card to get more clues.</p>  <p>The Detective gets only one guess, and they must guess all four facts correctly to win. Once the Detective has guessed, the round ends and the players switch roles with a new pack.</p>  <p>TO WIN:</p>  <p>Discover all four facts using as few cards as possible. The Detective who guesses correctly using the fewest clue cards wins! If neither player guessed correctly, or if there is a tie, play another round!</p>               </div> </div>        <p class="card-legality-warning">           <b class="card-legality-warning-pill">Not Legal</b>           <span>             This card is memorabilia and not legal for play.           </span>         </p>     </div>

Randomly determine which team goes first, and then open a pack and remove any remaining land cards and any cards without _Magic_ card backs. Each team then picks a card and puts it face down on the table without looking at it.</p>  <p>LET’S PLAY:</p>  <p>On your turn, your team has 30 seconds to examine your card before handing it over to the opposing team. Then they ask your team five questions about your card. Once you’ve answered them all, note your score. Now it’s your team’s turn to ask the questions!

    A thick pea soup fog rolling down the streets and alleyways
    A tight formation of drones races down the street, just above head height
    A vid-blogger in full, wearable array, blatantly recording the scene
    A wage-slave arguing with her phone’s onboard AI, before breaking down crying
    AC vents in the sidewalk emitting a thick cloud of vapour
    All the nearby street signs are gang-tagged over to the point of being useless
    All the street lights for this entire block just went out
    An abandoned cybernetic limb lies forlornly by the kerb
    An ancient looking geriatric lopes past strapped into a linear assistance frame
    An automated noodle vending truck, jingle playing, folds open and deploys nearby
    An energetic street preacher giving a digital presentation on Cybernetic Jesus®
    An orange, multi-limbed, window cleaning remote clambers up the building facade
    An out-of-order ATM threatens violent action to passers by who stray too close
    An overpass or skywalk covered in colourful advertising animatics (see below)
    Animated street art that twists and turns across two adjoining walls
    Armoured cops bundle violently reluctant vagrant into ErA-plated squad car
    Every underlit face on the street is concentrating solely on their phone
    Filthy red and white plastic Jersey barriers block most of the sidewalk
    Frantic homeless people, washing vehicle windscreens before the lights change
    Gritty, chemical infused sediment sloughing off a nearby rooftop
    Pedestrians flooding across the nearest intersection, en masse, both ways
    Rivers of rain-borne trash race along in the choked gutters
    Searchlights playing across the cloud cover and projecting branding (see below)
    The flashing orange lights of a fat, dirty-yellow street sweeping remote
    The nearest building has an intermittently flickering security light
    The rainbow incandescence of oil on a large puddle of dirty water
    The scorched shell of a gutted vid-phone kiosk
    The sidewalk consists of slabs of flickering screens, showing adverts (see below)
    The substandard cheapcrete is pockmarked by years of corrosive rains
    There are crowds of fast moving people swarming absolutely everywhere
    Unattended roadworks, the area coned off and lit for safety for no good reason
    Unnervingly, there is absolutely no-one about
    Your view is blocked by a lumbering hi-vis recycling collection truck
    Your way is barred by a precarious heap of obsolete electronics
